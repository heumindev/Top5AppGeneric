      {
        "question": "How much protein do I need daily for muscle building?",
        "answer": "For muscle building, most research suggests consuming 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily. For a 70kg (154lb) person, that's approximately 112-154 grams of protein per day, spread across 4-5 meals."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the best high-protein foods for building muscle?",
        "answer": "The best high-protein foods include chicken breast (31g per 100g), Greek yogurt (10g per 100g), eggs (13g per 100g), lean beef (26g per 100g), salmon (25g per 100g), cottage cheese (11g per 100g), and legumes like lentils (9g per 100g cooked)."
      },
      {
        "question": "When is the best time to eat protein for muscle growth?",
        "answer": "Research shows protein timing matters less than total daily intake. However, consuming 20-40g of protein within 2 hours after exercise can optimize muscle protein synthesis. Spreading protein intake evenly across meals (every 3-4 hours) is also beneficial."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I get enough protein without meat?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can meet protein needs without meat. Plant-based protein sources include tofu (8g per 100g), tempeh (19g per 100g), legumes, quinoa (4g per 100g cooked), seitan (25g per 100g), and protein-rich dairy like Greek yogurt and cottage cheese."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes a recipe high-protein?",
        "answer": "A recipe is considered high-protein when it provides 20+ grams of protein per serving. Our top 5 recipes average 35-50g of protein per serving, making them ideal for muscle building and recovery."
