    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is matcha and how is it different from regular green tea?",
        "answer": "Matcha is finely ground powder made from specially grown green tea leaves. Unlike regular green tea where leaves are steeped and removed, with matcha you consume the whole leaf, getting more antioxidants, caffeine, and L-theanine. The plants are shade-grown for 3-4 weeks before harvest, increasing chlorophyll and amino acids."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the health benefits of matcha?",
        "answer": "Matcha is rich in antioxidants (especially EGCG), provides calm energy from the combination of caffeine and L-theanine, supports metabolism, enhances focus and concentration, and may help with detoxification due to its high chlorophyll content. One cup of matcha equals about 10 cups of regular green tea in antioxidants."
      },
      {
        "question": "What grade of matcha should I use for recipes?",
        "answer": "Use ceremonial grade matcha for drinking straight (lattes, traditional preparation) and culinary grade for baking and cooking. Culinary grade is more affordable and has a stronger flavor that stands up to other ingredients. Both grades offer the same health benefits."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I prevent matcha from clumping?",
        "answer": "Sift your matcha through a fine mesh strainer before mixing. Use a bamboo whisk (chasen) or electric frother to blend it with a small amount of liquid first before adding more. Never add matcha directly to hot liquid without whisking."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I store matcha powder?",
        "answer": "Store matcha in an airtight container in the refrigerator or freezer, away from light, heat, and moisture. Once opened, use within 1-2 months for best flavor and color. Matcha oxidizes quickly, which diminishes its vibrant green color and fresh taste."

      "faq": [
        {
          "question": "How much caffeine is in matcha?",
          "answer": "One teaspoon of matcha contains about 70mg of caffeine, similar to a cup of coffee. However, the L-theanine in matcha modulates how caffeine is released, providing steady energy over 4-6 hours rather than a spike and crash."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I drink matcha every day?",
          "answer": "Yes, 1-2 cups of matcha daily is generally safe for most adults. This provides health benefits without excessive caffeine. Pregnant women should limit to 1 cup and consult their doctor. Best consumed before 2pm to avoid sleep disruption."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is quality matcha so expensive?",
          "answer": "High-quality matcha requires shade-growing for 3-4 weeks, hand-picking the youngest leaves, removing stems and veins, and slow stone-grinding (30g per hour). This labor-intensive process, combined with limited growing regions in Japan, makes authentic matcha a premium product."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between Japanese and Chinese matcha?",
          "answer": "Japanese matcha (especially from Uji, Kyoto) is considered the gold standard due to centuries of refinement in cultivation and processing. Chinese matcha is often more affordable but typically lower quality with less vibrant color and flavor. For best results, choose Japanese-origin matcha."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does matcha expire?",
          "answer": "Unopened matcha lasts 6-12 months when stored properly. Once opened, use within 1-2 months for best flavor, color, and potency. Matcha doesn't become unsafe but loses its vibrant color, fresh taste, and some nutritional benefits over time."
